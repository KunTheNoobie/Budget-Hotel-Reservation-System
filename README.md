## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **.NET 9 SDK** - Download and install from [Microsoft's official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
2. **SQL Server Express** or **LocalDB** - Included with Visual Studio or download separately
3. **Visual Studio 2022** or later (recommended) or any IDE with .NET 9 support

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or extract the project**
   ```bash
   # If using git
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Budget-Hotel-Reservation-System-master
   ```

2. **Open the solution**
   - Open `Assignment.slnx` in Visual Studio 2022 or later
   - Or use command line: `dotnet restore`

3. **Restore NuGet packages**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Configure connection string** (if needed)
   - Open `Assignment/appsettings.json`
   - Update the `DefaultConnection` string if your SQL Server instance differs
   - Default uses LocalDB: `Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=BMIT2023_HotelReservation;...`

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project Assignment
   ```
   - Or press F5 in Visual Studio
   - The application will automatically:
     - Create the database if it doesn't exist
     - Apply migrations
     - Seed initial data

6. **Access the application**
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`
   - The exact port will be shown in the console output

## 💾 Database Setup

The system supports two methods for database initialization:

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended for Quick Start)

The application automatically creates the database and seeds initial data on first run:

1. Run the application once
2. The `DbInitializer` will create:
   - 2 Hotels (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)
   - 5 Users (1 Admin, 1 Manager, 3 Customers)
   - 4 Room Types
   - 10 Rooms
   - 10 Amenities
   - 3 Active Promotions
   - 2 Sample Bookings

**Note**: For comprehensive sample data with all hotels having managers and staff, use Option 2 (SQL Scripts) instead.

### Option 2: SQL Scripts (Comprehensive Sample Data - RECOMMENDED)

For a more extensive dataset with all hotels having managers and staff assigned:

1. **Run Entity Framework migrations** to create the database structure:
   ```bash
   cd Assignment
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. **Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or Azure Data Studio
3. **Connect to your SQL Server instance** (LocalDB or SQL Server Express)
4. **Select your database**: `BMIT2023_HotelReservation`
5. **Run the complete database script**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute: Assignment/Scripts/03_CompleteNewDatabase.sql
   ```
   ⚠️ **Note**: This script clears existing data and inserts fresh sample data.

   This inserts:
   - 15 Hotels (each with 1 Manager and 1 Staff assigned)
   - 43 Users (1 Admin + 15 Managers + 15 Staff + 12 Customers)
   - 15 Amenities
   - 20 Room Types
   - 25 Rooms
   - 30 Room Images
   - 50 Room Type-Amenity relationships
   - 15 Services
   - 15 Packages
   - 30 Package Items
   - 15 Promotions
   - 15 Bookings
   - 15 Reviews
   - 12 Contact Messages
   - 12 Newsletter Subscriptions

**Hotel Assignments**: Each of the 15 hotels has been assigned:
- 1 Manager (manager1@hotel.com through manager15@hotel.com)
- 1 Staff (staff1@hotel.com through staff15@hotel.com)

7. **Set admin passwords** (if using SQL scripts):
   - After running SQL scripts, admin passwords are placeholders
   - Run the application once - `DbInitializer` will set proper passwords for admin accounts
   - Or use the password reset feature

## 🔐 Login Credentials

### Admin Accounts

| Email | Password | Role | Access | Hotel Assignment |
|-------|----------|------|--------|------------------|
| `admin@hotel.com` | `Admin123!` | Admin | Full system access | None (sees all hotels) |
| `manager1@hotel.com` - `manager15@hotel.com` | `Manager123!` | Manager | Hotel management | One hotel each (Hotel 1-15) |
| `staff1@hotel.com` - `staff15@hotel.com` | `Password123!` | Staff | Limited admin access | One hotel each (Hotel 1-15) |

**Note**: If you used the SQL script (`03_CompleteNewDatabase.sql`), all 15 hotels have managers and staff assigned. Each manager/staff can only see their assigned hotel's data.

**Accessing Admin Panel:**
1. Login with admin, manager, or staff account
2. You will be automatically redirected to the admin panel
3. Use the role-specific dropdown menu (Admin/Manager/Staff) in the navigation bar
4. Or navigate directly to `/Admin/Index`

### Customer Accounts

| Email | Password | Role | Status | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|--------|-------|
| `ahmad@example.com` | `Ahmad123!` | Customer | Email Verified, Active | Has existing bookings |
| `siti@example.com` | `Siti123!` | Customer | Email Verified, Active | Has pending bookings |
| `charlie@example.com` | `Charlie123!` | Customer | Email NOT Verified, Active | Test email verification flow |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### appsettings.json

Key configuration settings:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=BMIT2023_HotelReservation;..."
  },
  "EncryptionKey": "E546C8DF278CD5931069B522E695D4F2",
  "SecuritySettings": {
    "MaxLoginAttempts": 3,
    "LockoutMinutes": 15
  },
  "EmailSettings": {
    "SmtpHost": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "SmtpPort": 587,
    "SmtpUsername": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "SmtpPassword": "your-app-password",
    "FromEmail": "noreply@hotel.com",
    "FromName": "Budget Hotel Reservation System",
    "BaseUrl": "https://localhost:5001"
  }
}
```

### Important Configuration Notes

- **Connection String**: Update if using a different SQL Server instance
- **EncryptionKey**: Used for encrypting sensitive data (change in production!)
- **SecuritySettings**: Configure login attempt limits and lockout duration
- **EmailSettings**: Configure SMTP settings for sending verification emails and OTP codes

#### Email Configuration Guide

The application uses MailKit to send emails for:
- **Email Verification**: Users receive a verification link when registering
- **Password Reset OTP**: Users receive a 6-digit OTP code for password reset

**For Gmail:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the App Password (not your regular password) in `SmtpPassword`
4. Set `SmtpHost` to `"smtp.gmail.com"` and `SmtpPort` to `587`

**For Other Email Providers:**
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: `smtp-mail.outlook.com`, Port `587`
- **Yahoo**: `smtp.mail.yahoo.com`, Port `587`
- **Custom SMTP**: Use your provider's SMTP settings

**Development/Testing:**
- If email settings are not configured, the system will show fallback links/OTPs in the UI
- For production, ensure all email settings are properly configured

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Email Functionality**: Real email sending using MailKit (SMTP). Configure email settings in `appsettings.json` for email verification and password reset OTP
- **Email Verification**: Users receive a real verification email with a clickable link when registering
- **Password Reset**: Uses OTP (One-Time Password) sent via email - users receive a 6-digit code to reset their password
- **Database**: Uses file-based SQL Server Express (LocalDB)
- **Currency**: Displayed in RM (Malaysian Ringgit)
- **Soft Delete**: All entities support soft delete functionality
- **Admin Protection**: Main admin account (`admin@hotel.com`) cannot be deleted
- **Database Schema**: PromotionUsage merged into Booking table, FavoriteRoomType feature removed, Review linked to Booking only
- **Module Assignments**: Each of 4 team members is responsible for at least 2 core modules (see Key Modules section above)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure SQL Server Express or LocalDB is installed
- Check connection string in `appsettings.json`

### Migration Issues
- Delete the database and let the application recreate it
- Or manually apply migrations: `dotnet ef database update`

### Port Already in Use

### Soft Delete Pattern

All major entities support **soft delete**:
- `IsDeleted` flag (boolean) - marks entity as deleted
- `DeletedAt` timestamp (nullable DateTime) - records when deletion occurred
- Global query filters automatically exclude soft-deleted records from queries
- Allows data recovery and maintains referential integrity

### Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using BCrypt (never stored in plain text)
- **Data Encryption**: Phone numbers are encrypted using AES-256 encryption
- **Token Security**: Security tokens are time-limited and single-use
- **Audit Logging**: Security events are logged for compliance and monitoring
